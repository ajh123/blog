In Minecraft, automation is a key aspect of enhancing gameplay and efficiency. One such use is building an automated postal network that can transport items between different locations in the game. By using Lua scripting provided by the CC: Tweaked mod, we can create a system that can handle item transportation in a structured manner, inspired by real-world networking concepts like the TCP/IP Model .

## How does networking relate to item transportation?

In computer networking, data is transmitted across networks using a layered approach, as defined by the TCP/IP Model . Each layer has specific responsibilities and standards, from physical transmission to application-level protocols. @cite{fortinet2025} Similarly, in Minecraft, we can think of item transportation as a multi-layered process:

1. **Link Layer** *(Transport method)*: This layer is the physical act of sending and receiving of items. Whether it is through minecart tracks, hoppers, or even Trains from the Create mod it does not matter. This is similar to how network data can travel through Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi in real-world networking. @cite{fortinet2025}
2. **Internet Layer** *(Postcodes and addresses)*: This layer ensures that items are correctly transferred to the destination by routing between networks. For Minecraft, we will create a system that uses item name addresses ([more on this later](#package-addressing)) to ensure that items are routed correctly.
3. **Transport Layer** This layer is typically responsible for packet splitting, sequencing and reassembly @cite{fortinet2025}. However in Minecraft this would require automated item renaming to create individual packages, which is not possible. @cite{tweaked2025}
4. **Application Layer** *(The package contents)*: This is the actual payload the user wants to send, in the real-networking the application data like HTTP, FTP, etc. @cite{fortinet2025} In our case, this is the item itself, such as diamonds, iron ingots, or any other item in Minecraft.

## Package addressing

When sending items through our postal network, we need a way to address them correctly. In real-world postal systems, this is done using addresses and postcodes. In our Minecraft postal network, we will get players to rename items to include their destination address.

We will use the following format where the largest geographical area is listed first, down to the most specific location:

```
Country:State:City:Street:HouseNumber
```

The format is flexible one can include as many or as few levels as they want, but the order must be maintained. For example:

- `SheepLand:Northshire:Sheepville:Wool St:1` - A full address including country, state, city, street, and house number.
- `SheepLand:Northshire:Sheepville` - A more general address that only includes the country, state, and city. This means the item will be delivered to a central location in Sheepville.
- `SheepLand` - The most general address, only specifying the country. This could be used for items that are to be delivered to a central hub in the country.
- `Northshire:Sheepville` - An address that omits the country, assuming it is within the same country as the sender.

### Why use item names and geographical areas for addressing?

1. **Compatible with Minecraft**: Using item names for addressing is straightforward and easy to implement within the constraints of Minecraft's item system.
2. **Supports Scripting**: We can programmatically read item names using Lua scripts in CC: Tweaked, making it easy to extract the address information.
3. **Less error prone**: It is impossible to rename items pragmatically, so players must manually set the address with an Anvil. By choosing a human readable format, we reduce the chances of errors in addressing. Its also the very reason why DNS (Domain Name System) exists in real-world networking which turns domain names into IP addresses. @cite{fortinet2025a}
4. **Hierarchical**: Using geographical areas allows for a hierarchical addressing system, similar to real-world postal systems, which can help in routing items efficiently.
5. **Backwards compatibility with existing addressing formats**: For example `TreeLand:dsffddfhfd7d8` which uses a TreeLand specific format of `dsffddfhfd7d8`, **however one may need automated item renaming** to strip the global prefix once the package arrives in TreeLand, **which is something both Minecraft or CC: Tweaked do not support** natively. @cite{tweaked2025}

### Address Registration and Validation

It is inevitable that players will make mistakes when renaming items. To mitigate this, we can implement a validation system that checks the address format before processing the item for delivery.

We will build an address book that contains all valid geographical areas and how they are linked together. This will work similar to how routers use routing table in computer networking @cite{cloudflare2025}.

When an item is processed, the system will check the address against this address book to ensure it is valid. If the address is invalid, the shipment would not be sent.

Furthermore, the address book could be decentralised, meaning each location could maintain a list of neighbouring locations. This would allow for a more dynamic and scalable addressing system, as locations could be added or removed without needing to update a central database.

However, this would require a protocol similar to BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) used in real-world networking to exchange routing information about which networks connect to each other. @cite{cloudflare2025}

## Package assembly and transport

1. **Package Preparation**: 
  - To send a item, the player would first rename it with the desired address using an Anvil. The item would then be placed into a designated "outgoing" chest connected to a Computer.
  - The Computer would run a Lua script that scans the chest for items, validates their addresses using the address book.
2. **Routing through hubs**:
  - The script would determine the best route for each package based on the address. This involves sending the package to the next hub in the route towards the destination.
  - Each hub would have its own Computer running a similar script that handles incoming packages, checks their addresses, and forwards them to the next hop in the route.
  - Form earlier, we know each hub would maintain a list of neighbouring hubs to facilitate routing known as an address book.
3. **Final Delivery**:
  - Once a package reaches its destination hub, the script would check if the address matches the local area. If it does, the package would be shipped to the final destination in the area, similar to how a router delivers packets to a client on a local area network.
  - If the address does not match, the package would be stored as lost mail, and the player would need to contact the hub operator to retrieve it.

## Conclusion and what's next?

By taking inspiration from real-world networking concepts and using Lua scripting in CC: Tweaked, we can create an automated postal network in Minecraft that efficiently transports items between locations. This system not only enhances gameplay but also provides a fun and educational way to learn about networking principles. The next article in this series will cover the address book and routing protocols in more detail.
